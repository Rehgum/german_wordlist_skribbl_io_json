# :bookmark_tabs: [JSON] German Wordlist for Skribbl.io :bookmark_tabs:

This is a (maybe not well maintained) GERMAN wordlist for the database on the Minigame-Website "Skribbl.io"
You can use this to:
- learn all the possible words for the game
- use it with a cheat engine that guesses the word by comparing the letters
- code you own cheat engine and use this .json as a reference

_Please always play fair and don't use this on public servers (only with friends)_

Words are in an unsorted .json array like:
> ["Word1","Word2","..."]

This is just a list related to the game - im not responsible for what you do with it.
